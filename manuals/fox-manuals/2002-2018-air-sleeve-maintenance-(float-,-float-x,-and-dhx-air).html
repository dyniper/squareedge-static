																											<p>The air seals inside FOX air shocks do a lot of work and should be replaced regularly in order to maintain optimal performance and prevent wear. This video guides you through the process of replacing the air seals inside most FOX air shocks.</p>

																		<p><span class='alert'>WARNING:</span> Never attempt to pull apart, open, disassemble, or service a FOX shock that is in a "stuck down" condition. A "stuck down" condition results from a failure of the dynamic air seal (located between the positive and negative air chambers within the shock air sleeve), resulting with the negative chamber retaining a higher pressure than the positive chamber. To test whether the shock is in fact "stuck down":</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the air cap and depress the Schrader valve, to completely release air pressure from the positive chamber of the shock.
<ul>
<li>If your shock has an EVOL air sleeve, you must release air pressure slowly to stop from inducing a "stuck down" condition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the shock body retracts into the air sleeve near bottom-out after the air is slowly released from the positive chamber, attach a FOX high pressure pump and pressurize the shock to 250 psi/ 17 bar).
<ul>
<li>If your shock has an EVOL air sleeve, you must cycle the shock after every 50psi addition while filling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the shock does not fully extend, it is in a "stuck down" condition.&nbsp;</li>
